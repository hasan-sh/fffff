The heat from the fire was thought to weaken the hunters and also make the game watchful. Everyone slept on his side with his knees flexed, ‘like the game.’ If a man wished to turn over he assumed a standing position, stretched his legs, and then lay down. ‘If he did not do this he would get sick.’ Sleeping in the correct manner was thought to make it possible for the hunter to approach the game without frightening it. The leader closed the instructions, saying, ‘We want to rise before dawn tomorrow so we can have a little ceremony. Try to remember whatever you dream during the night.’ [109]',\n",
       "   \"To place his arrow effectively, a hunter must hit his prey in a fleshy part where the arrow may penetrate to a depth of 8 to 10 cm so that its poison may be dissolved by the animal's blood and carried throughout the body. To achieve this with a weapon of such limited range and accuracy requires considerable ability. Most game animals range too widely and shift their grazing grounds too frequently to allow G/wi hunters to predict their movements accurately enough to make it possible to organize beats in which the animals may be driven toward bowmen concealed at a prearranged spot (although this was apparently possible in better-favored parts of southern Africa; cf. Livingstone, 1857; Stow, 1905). The game must be taken where it is found, and to find it at all is a matter of luck, knowledge of the country and of the habits of the various game species, and up-to-date intelligence of their movements, which is gained from others' observations and the hunter's own interpretation of the signs of the animals' movements.\",\n",
       "   'HUNTING DOGS.—A lot of skinny, mangy dogs, esteemed for their skill in stirring up the game, are found in the Indian villages. With the aid of large dogs trained for the purpose, the jaguar is cornered and the puma is driven up a tree, where it may easily be shot by the hunter. When the Indian ascends a stream he keeps close to the river bank and lets his dog range the woods. The latter, upon scaring up some game, will give tongue immediately and endeavor to drive it to the water. This is the common way of hunting the paca which lives at the river bank and plunges into the water when pursued. This rodent also enters hollow trees and burrows in the ground and is then difficult to secure. Its meat is delicious and is appreciated by the average foreigner.',\n",
       "   \"{{224}} animal was feeding. By the size of the hoof prints, he is able to say if the animal was a bull or a cow. Should the tracks be two days old or more, they are abandoned; otherwise the hunter sets out to follow. Tracking requires careful walking and moccasins are always worn. The tracker avoids stepping on dead wood and is cautious not to break or snap twigs as he passes through brushy places. He watches the wind so as to approach the animal with the current blowing from the latter's direction. When the trail veers from the wind, the hunter abandons the track and, heading with the wind, makes a half circle so as to come on the moose a mile or so further on. Should he come out below the moose, he judges the character of the country before him and the signs of the track. If he knows the area ahead to be thickly covered with willow and other brush, and if the evidence in torn soil, droppings, and bruised twigs is very fresh, the hunter suspects that the animal is only a short distance off, feeding or lying down. Again the hunter makes a half circle calculated to bring him close enough to the unsuspecting animal to venture a shot. Sometimes such a circuit brings the hunter up ahead of the moose. He must then retrace his steps, circling back to where he believes the moose to be. Often deep brush intervenes in the hunter's pursuit, causing him to lose his game either by missing the trail or by frightening the animal with noises. To these difficulties must be added the hazard of coughing. Returning from a moose hunt in the fall of 1945, Old Man said that the hunters coughed so much from colds that they frightened all moose away. When he was out tracking and a paroxysm of coughing threatened, Old Man threw himself flat on the ground to suppress the noise. In the fall, when moose are breeding, the haphazard tracks of the bull are hopeless to follow, and tracking is abandoned, since the bull “never rests.” At this time a hunter will try to attract a bull or cow within range of his gun by imitating the bull's call or by rubbing an old moose horn or scapula on a tree.\",\n",
       "   'The leader then put on his hunting cap and cloak. The buckskin cap fitted snugly over the head and was secured by a chin strap attached to flaps over the ears. A large blackbird was sewed on the top. This cap was made especially for the corral hunt and used only in it. The cloak consisted merely of the buckskin on which the birds had rested during the ceremony. This was also used only in the corral hunt. It was called by the same name as the shirt worn by the stalker. ‘This costume caused the leader to be like the rest of the game. In this costume they were not afraid of him.’ When the costume was on, the leader picked up the two birds and left the circle, going clockwise (R. H.).'],\n",

      "Sentence:  Next the leader instructed the party how to sleep. They were not allowed to lie flat on their backs because the soles of their feet would be toward the fire. The heat from the fire was thought to weaken the hunters and also make the game watchful. Everyone slept on his side with his knees flexed, ‘like the game.’ If a man wished to turn over he assumed a standing position, stretched his legs, and then lay down. ‘If he did not do this he would get sick.’ Sleeping in the correct manner was thought to make it possible for the hunter to approach the game without frightening it. The leader closed the instructions, saying, ‘We want to rise before dawn tomorrow so we can have a little ceremony. Try to remember whatever you dream during the night.’ [109]\n",

      "Sentence:  To place his arrow effectively, a hunter must hit his prey in a fleshy part where the arrow may penetrate to a depth of 8 to 10 cm so that its poison may be dissolved by the animal's blood and carried throughout the body. To achieve this with a weapon of such limited range and accuracy requires considerable ability. Most game animals range too widely and shift their grazing grounds too frequently to allow G/wi hunters to predict their movements accurately enough to make it possible to organize beats in which the animals may be driven toward bowmen concealed at a prearranged spot (although this was apparently possible in better-favored parts of southern Africa; cf. Livingstone, 1857; Stow, 1905). The game must be taken where it is found, and to find it at all is a matter of luck, knowledge of the country and of the habits of the various game species, and up-to-date intelligence of their movements, which is gained from others' observations and the hunter's own interpretation of the signs of the animals' movements.\n",

      "Sentence:  HUNTING DOGS.—A lot of skinny, mangy dogs, esteemed for their skill in stirring up the game, are found in the Indian villages. With the aid of large dogs trained for the purpose, the jaguar is cornered and the puma is driven up a tree, where it may easily be shot by the hunter. When the Indian ascends a stream he keeps close to the river bank and lets his dog range the woods. The latter, upon scaring up some game, will give tongue immediately and endeavor to drive it to the water. This is the common way of hunting the paca which lives at the river bank and plunges into the water when pursued. This rodent also enters hollow trees and burrows in the ground and is then difficult to secure. Its meat is delicious and is appreciated by the average foreigner.\n",

      "Sentence:  {{224}} animal was feeding. By the size of the hoof prints, he is able to say if the animal was a bull or a cow. Should the tracks be two days old or more, they are abandoned; otherwise the hunter sets out to follow. Tracking requires careful walking and moccasins are always worn. The tracker avoids stepping on dead wood and is cautious not to break or snap twigs as he passes through brushy places. He watches the wind so as to approach the animal with the current blowing from the latter's direction. When the trail veers from the wind, the hunter abandons the track and, heading with the wind, makes a half circle so as to come on the moose a mile or so further on. Should he come out below the moose, he judges the character of the country before him and the signs of the track. If he knows the area ahead to be thickly covered with willow and other brush, and if the evidence in torn soil, droppings, and bruised twigs is very fresh, the hunter suspects that the animal is only a short distance off, feeding or lying down. Again the hunter makes a half circle calculated to bring him close enough to the unsuspecting animal to venture a shot. Sometimes such a circuit brings the hunter up ahead of the moose. He must then retrace his steps, circling back to where he believes the moose to be. Often deep brush intervenes in the hunter's pursuit, causing him to lose his game either by missing the trail or by frightening the animal with noises. To these difficulties must be added the hazard of coughing. Returning from a moose hunt in the fall of 1945, Old Man said that the hunters coughed so much from colds that they frightened all moose away. When he was out tracking and a paroxysm of coughing threatened, Old Man threw himself flat on the ground to suppress the noise. In the fall, when moose are breeding, the haphazard tracks of the bull are hopeless to follow, and tracking is abandoned, since the bull “never rests.” At this time a hunter will try to attract a bull or cow within range of his gun by imitating the bull's call or by rubbing an old moose horn or scapula on a tree.\n",

      "Sentence:  The leader then put on his hunting cap and cloak. The buckskin cap fitted snugly over the head and was secured by a chin strap attached to flaps over the ears. A large blackbird was sewed on the top. This cap was made especially for the corral hunt and used only in it. The cloak consisted merely of the buckskin on which the birds had rested during the ceremony. This was also used only in the corral hunt. It was called by the same name as the shirt worn by the stalker. ‘This costume caused the leader to be like the rest of the game. In this costume they were not afraid of him.’ When the costume was on, the leader picked up the two birds and left the circle, going clockwise (R. H.).\n",

If they ran in the wrong direction, the other horseman built a fire to turn them. When they were headed toward the chute, both horsemen came out in the open and went after the antelope at full speed. As they passed the outermost brush piles each grasped the pile on his side. ‘This prevented the game from turning back.’ According to M. H., the brush piles were fired to prevent the antelope from turning.\n",

      "Sentence:  At the height of the snaring season each hunter will have three lines in operation. Each line will have 7–9 gaps set with snares. The Dobe camp hunters who had set 20–25 separate snares averaged one small animal per hunter per week throughout the winter. A hunter's success in snaring depends upon his interpretation of game tracks and the patience with which he habituates the animals to crossing his lines where he wants them to. The hunters operate snarelines only in the winter because at other times of the year __both__ the hunters and the quarry are ranging farther into the desert and the men do not remain long enough at one camp to build and maintain the snarelines.\n",

Ikpakhuak was reputed to be one of the best bowmen in Dolphin and Union strait, and the maximum distance he could send an arrow was about 125 yards. Even at a fixed target his marksmanship was indifferent. During the summer of 1915 the natives set up a clod of earth about a foot square for a target. They went back forty paces and tried their skill, but only about one shot in twenty hit the mark. The men seemed to be no more accurate than the children, though, their bows being stronger, their arrows flew with more velocity. Two of the women joined in the sport, using their husbands' or their children's bows; they acquitted themselves hardly less creditably than the others. I frequently watched the men shooting at ptarmigan and water-fowl, and without exception their marksmanship was poor. It was no better even with larger game. They could hardly fail to hit a caribou at fifteen or twenty yards when the animal was stationary, but I have seen them miss a running deer at this range. They themselves admit that the bow is of little use at distances greater than about thirty yards. It is worth noticing that one of the best archers in the whole him pretend to graze also and keep his distance, and the deer will probably come nearer still. It seldom comes close enough for the man himself to shoot, but nearly always there is another hunter concealed close by for whom the first acts only as a blind.\",\n",

Then rocks were heated and everyone took a sweat bath, while the leader sang.

It often happened that the hunter found himself surrounded by the flying herd, and in a cloud of dust, so that neither man nor horse could see the ground before them. Under such circumstances fatal accidents to both men and horses were numerous. It was not an uncommon thing for half-breeds to shoot each other in the excitement of the chase; and while now and then a wounded bull suddenly turned upon his pursuer and overthrew him, the greatest number of casualties were from falls.” [^^   ((10)) Hornaday, ~~Extermination of the American Bison, Washington, 1887~~ , 471. ^^] Every year great hunting parties of half-breeds went west from the Red River and the enormous number of buffaloes killed show definitely the skill which they developed in hunting by the chase, for this was their chief method. Some idea of the size of these parties can be gained from the account of Father Belcourt who accompanied the Red River half-breeds on one of these expeditions. Altho this is a small party, compared to many, it contained 213 carts, 55 hunters and their families, making 60 lodges in all. This party killed 1,776 cows, bulls were not counted, although many were killed, which yielded 228 bags of pemmican, 1,213 bales of dried meat, 166 sacs of tallow and 556 bladders full of marrow.

A man, woman or child as the case might be, would catch a fish in the rocks, and would pop it into his mouth head first and chew up the head; the body quickly followed, convulsively protesting with its tail until that disappeared from sight and was crushed between the teeth. In most cases nothing more was seen of the fish, but if there were a few people there, and the haul was likely to be large, then some of the people would take the trouble to spit out the skin or else bite the head of the fish and then strip the skin off by catching hold of it with the teeth and sleeving the fish, eating the body afterwards and throwing the skin away.’',\n",

The women used handnets to scoop up the fish while the men impaled them with fishing arrows or clubbed them. At large __timbó__ parties the water was poisoned by two or three separate groups at points about 1000 feet apart along the stream. As soon as the fish began fleeing downstream from the group furthest upstream, a sentinel stationed a short distance downstream gave several loud shouts to the next group, signalling them to start poisoning the water. The fish thus had very little opportunity to escape to pure water. To prevent any from making their escape, a dam made of branches set into the stream bottom was sometimes placed about simile downstream from the fishing location. A space was left open until the morning of the fishing to allow the fish to swim upstream during the night. This system is particularly effective when fishing for the __matrinchão__ ( __Brycon brevicaudatus__ Gunther) that swims up the smaller streams every night to sleep and then returns downstream with the coming of day.',\n",
       "   '{{224}} “Most of the caribou killed, however, are secured by the concerted action of several men, women, and children. Even the dogs help. When a band is discovered feeding a V-shaped ‘fence’ is constructed somewhere beyond their line of vision, generally to leeward. The ‘fence’ consists of straight lines of stones or pieces of sod raised on end and set twenty to forty yards apart. In spring, blocks of snow are used instead. These stones, sods or blocks of snow are often not over eighteen inches high and no particular pains need be taken as to their shape or appearance, though a dab of earth is usually put on a block of snow or light colored stone so as to make sure the animals will see it. Apparently the eyesight of caribou is very poor, as compared with that of man. When this fence is completed, (a half dozen men make one a mile long in an hour), the men conceal themselves in the angle of the V, the women and children with the dogs, go to windward of the deer to drive them. Usually the deer do not see the women who go to their windward. A few long-drawn wolf howls will generally set a band of deer in slow motion before the wind, or in the direction they are migrating. If they attempt to pass outside one of the wings of the V, someone is there to turn them, and usually the band moving in single file along one side the V-shaped fence, much like horses along a barbed-wire fence, arrives at a walk or slow trot at the point where the angle of the fence becomes so narrow, (about one hundred yards), that they begin to notice the fence on the other side and to see there is no opening. Then they bunch up irresolutely and give the hunters a good opportunity to shoot. Members of our party have seen only as many as eleven caribou killed in this way by four hunters and half-a-dozen women and children. It is uncertain how many they get in lucky hauls, none can tell themselves, for none can count, but they considered eleven a small catch. Perhaps six to eight animals per hunter may be near the ordinary limit, though we have been told that occasionally not a single animal escapes of those that once enter the fence.”',\n",

The caribou on reaching the fences continue along them until they enter the enclosed corral at the end. Some caribou attempt to get through the spaces left in the wing fences and are there snared. Others going into the corral run around its edges clockwise. Those which do not become entangled in the snares set for them are shot with bows and arrows if they attempt to come out.',\n",

       "   \"A man of Waitambu had two daughters: one married into Wathiwathi; the other, called Ndranindongo, came to Tumbou as the wife of a man of Nandomole in Thekena. The people of Waitambu gave her mullet-fishing saying, “Let it be for your soup ( ~~su~~ ) in your house.” With it they gave a gulley ( ~~soso~~ ) in Waitambu as dowry ( ~~i kau~~ ). Either she or a female descendant of hers gave the leading position on the seaward side to a daughter of hers who married into Tuware. Both the fishing and the gulley are still the property of the descendants of Ndranindongo. Formerly if any one besides the owners fished mullet there was trouble. If High Chief wishes mullet to be fished, he must ask Semi. If any one is building a house and desires to have mullets for a feast he offers up kava to Semi that he may instruct the women of Tumbou quarter to catch mullet. Semi then informs the women and they hold a council to decide matters and determine the place of each. All the women who are uterine descendants ( ~~kete yani~~ ) from Tumbou may take part. The women go out in two files, two to a net. The first two places are the “eyes” or “face of the fishing” ( ~~mata ni nggoli~~ ); these places have fixed owners as Semi decides: the one toward the sea belongs to Semi's wife and daughter (Semi belongs to Tuware as well as Tanggalevu), the other belongs to the Vaka's wife or some other woman of Nandomole. The other places are decided by “appropriating the fishing” ( ~~usu nggoli~~ ), which is done in this way: after some discussion they suddenly begin calling in quick succession: “I stand behind X”; “I stand next.” And so on they scramble for positions, and are placed in the order in which they spoke. As for the ladies of Tai who are not connected with Tumbou, they merely await the decision of the others. Between any two pairs from Tumbou there is an interval in which the nobles are placed; each woman of Tumbou decides which ladies from Tai and how many will stand between her and the next Tumbou net. The position next to the “eyes of the fishing” is fixed; it is called “following the fishing” ( ~~muri nggoli~~ ) and is given to Big House. The last woman of Tumbou is the “limit of the fishing” ( ~~i yalayala ni nggoli~~ ); after that the rest follow in any order, and are known as “the bottom of the fishing” ( ~~mboto ni nggoli~~ ).\",\n",

Before dawn of the next day, or the afternoon before, if the chosen fishing site was distant, the party embarked. The best places to fish with __timbó__ were in restricted bodies of water where the poison would have greatest density and the fish the least possibility of escape. For this reason, streams and inter-island channels of about fifty feet in width or lagoons of limited size having only one entrance were preferred. Upon arriving at the location early in the morning, the party broke up into two, three, or possibly four groups, depending on the number of people involved. Those men who were to poison the water went upstream while the rest of the men and the accompanying women and children waited for the stunned fish to swim downstream.

       "   \"{{224}} My own observations led me to a less favourable conclusion. Ikpakhuak was reputed to be one of the best bowmen in Dolphin and Union strait, and the maximum distance he could send an arrow was about 125 yards. Even at a fixed target his marksmanship was indifferent. During the summer of 1915 the natives set up a clod of earth about a foot square for a target. They went back forty paces and tried their skill, but only about one shot in twenty hit the mark. The men seemed to be no more accurate than the children, though, their bows being stronger, their arrows flew with more velocity. Two of the women joined in the sport, using their husbands' or their children's bows; they acquitted themselves hardly less creditably than the others. I frequently watched the men shooting at ptarmigan and water-fowl, and without exception their marksmanship was poor. It was no better even with larger game. They could hardly fail to hit a caribou at fifteen or twenty yards when the animal was stationary, but I have seen them miss a running deer at this range. They themselves admit that the bow is of little use at distances greater than about thirty yards. It is worth noticing that one of the best archers in the whole him pretend to graze also and keep his distance, and the deer will probably come nearer still. It seldom comes close enough for the man himself to shoot, but nearly always there is another hunter concealed close by for whom the first acts only as a blind.\",\n",

       "   '{{224}} As long as the natives used only bows and arrows comparatively few caribou were shot by individuals hunting alone. The majority were obtained in drives, when the animals were either herded through narrow gaps where the archers lay concealed in shallow pits, or were driven into the lakes and speared while swimming. Richardson saw this latter method carried out on the Rae river. ‘The more active of the natives,’ he says, ‘go at this season to the meadows which we had crossed the previous day, and gradually drive the [149] animals to the inlet, hemming them in and compelling them, with the aid of their dogs, to take to the water. As soon as this takes place, the rest of the party, who are lying in wait in their kayaks, paddle towards the herd and spear as many of them as they can.’ [^^  “Richardson, p.188; cf. Dease and Simpson, Journ. Royal Geogr. Soc., Vol. 8, p. 218; Russell, p. 227; Stefansson, Anthrop. Papers. A. M. N. H., Vol. XIV, pt. I, p. 385, etc.” ^^] Lines of stones, with here and there a stick to which a coat or a flat resonant board is attached, are run down each side of the valley from the deer to the lake, where the hunters lie concealed in their kayaks.

There they stop irresolute, afraid to dash off to a flank on account of the barricade of stones and streamers. The ‘wolves’ draw nearer and nearer until the frightened deer one after the other rush into the water and try to swim across the lake. Then the kayakers dash out, each man armed with a short knife lashed on the end of a pole. One after another the helpless caribou are stabbed in the nape of the neck, nooses are thrown over their horns and their carcasses dragged to the shore.',\n",

There were at least two or three such nets, and their owners were the headmen for the drive. These men stood at the nets, a man at each intersection. Rabbits were driven in, one or two at a time. When a plot was exhausted they shifted the nets and drove in a different direction. Women stood by and watched; they also helped drive the animals into the net. Girls might stand at the net and twist the necks of entangled animals or kill them by pressing with the finger upon the soft spot on the head. Rabbits were carried by thrusting the head under the hunter's belt and allowing the body to dangle.\",\n",

Usually fishing is done by small groups, who disturb the fish so that actually fewer and smaller ones are now caught.

      "Sentence:  The downstream scene was always one of sheer pandemonium. Everybody was usually in the water trying to catch the fleeing fish which were already semi-stupified by the drug. The women used handnets to scoop up the fish while the men impaled them with fishing arrows or clubbed them. At large __timbó__ parties the water was poisoned by two or three separate groups at points about 1000 feet apart along the stream. As soon as the fish began fleeing downstream from the group furthest upstream, a sentinel stationed a short distance downstream gave several loud shouts to the next group, signalling them to start poisoning the water. The fish thus had very little opportunity to escape to pure water. To prevent any from making their escape, a dam made of branches set into the stream bottom was sometimes placed about simile downstream from the fishing location. A space was left open until the morning of the fishing to allow the fish to swim upstream during the night. This system is particularly effective when fishing for the __matrinchão__ ( __Brycon brevicaudatus__ Gunther) that swims up the smaller streams every night to sleep and then returns downstream with the coming of day.\n",

      "Sentence:  {{224}} “Most of the caribou killed, however, are secured by the concerted action of several men, women, and children. Even the dogs help. When a band is discovered feeding a V-shaped ‘fence’ is constructed somewhere beyond their line of vision, generally to leeward. The ‘fence’ consists of straight lines of stones or pieces of sod raised on end and set twenty to forty yards apart. In spring, blocks of snow are used instead. These stones, sods or blocks of snow are often not over eighteen inches high and no particular pains need be taken as to their shape or appearance, though a dab of earth is usually put on a block of snow or light colored stone so as to make sure the animals will see it. Apparently the eyesight of caribou is very poor, as compared with that of man. When this fence is completed, (a half dozen men make one a mile long in an hour), the men conceal themselves in the angle of the V, the women and children with the dogs, go to windward of the deer to drive them. Usually the deer do not see the women who go to their windward. A few long-drawn wolf howls will generally set a band of deer in slow motion before the wind, or in the direction they are migrating. If they attempt to pass outside one of the wings of the V, someone is there to turn them, and usually the band moving in single file along one side the V-shaped fence, much like horses along a barbed-wire fence, arrives at a walk or slow trot at the point where the angle of the fence becomes so narrow, (about one hundred yards), that they begin to notice the fence on the other side and to see there is no opening. Then they bunch up irresolutely and give the hunters a good opportunity to shoot. Members of our party have seen only as many as eleven caribou killed in this way by four hunters and half-a-dozen women and children. It is uncertain how many they get in lucky hauls, none can tell themselves, for none can count, but they considered eleven a small catch. Perhaps six to eight animals per hunter may be near the ordinary limit, though we have been told that occasionally not a single animal escapes of those that once enter the fence.”\n",

The people of Waitambu gave her mullet-fishing saying, “Let it be for your soup ( ~~su~~ ) in your house.” With it they gave a gulley ( ~~soso~~ ) in Waitambu as dowry ( ~~i kau~~ ).

The other places are decided by “appropriating the fishing” ( ~~usu nggoli~~ ), which is done in this way: after some discussion they suddenly begin calling in quick succession: “I stand behind X”; “I stand next.” And so on they scramble for positions, and are placed in the order in which they spoke.

      "Sentence:  {{224}} My own observations led me to a less favourable conclusion. Ikpakhuak was reputed to be one of the best bowmen in Dolphin and Union strait, and the maximum distance he could send an arrow was about 125 yards. Even at a fixed target his marksmanship was indifferent. During the summer of 1915 the natives set up a clod of earth about a foot square for a target. They went back forty paces and tried their skill, but only about one shot in twenty hit the mark. The men seemed to be no more accurate than the children, though, their bows being stronger, their arrows flew with more velocity. Two of the women joined in the sport, using their husbands' or their children's bows; they acquitted themselves hardly less creditably than the others. I frequently watched the men shooting at ptarmigan and water-fowl, and without exception their marksmanship was poor. It was no better even with larger game. They could hardly fail to hit a caribou at fifteen or twenty yards when the animal was stationary, but I have seen them miss a running deer at this range. They themselves admit that the bow is of little use at distances greater than about thirty yards. It is worth noticing that one of the best archers in the whole him pretend to graze also and keep his distance, and the deer will probably come nearer still. It seldom comes close enough for the man himself to shoot, but nearly always there is another hunter concealed close by for whom the first acts only as a blind.\n",

The majority were obtained in drives, when the animals were either herded through narrow gaps where the archers lay concealed in shallow pits, or were driven into the lakes and speared while swimming. Richardson saw this latter method carried out on the Rae river. ‘The more active of the natives,’ he says, ‘go at this season to the meadows which we had crossed the previous day, and gradually drive the [149] animals to the inlet, hemming them in and compelling them, with the aid of their dogs, to take to the water. As soon as this takes place, the rest of the party, who are lying in wait in their kayaks, paddle towards the herd and spear as many of them as they can.’ [^^  “Richardson, p.188; cf.

There they stop irresolute, afraid to dash off to a flank on account of the barricade of stones and streamers. The ‘wolves’ draw nearer and nearer until the frightened deer one after the other rush into the water and try to swim across the lake. Then the kayakers dash out, each man armed with a short knife lashed on the end of a pole.

They moved rapidly along, far in advance of the marching column, and from the tops of the highest hills carefully scanned the country before them in search of buffalo. If a herd was discerned, they were not to show themselves, nor in any way to alarm it. Having found the game, their duty was to observe its movement, learn where it was likely to be for the next few hours, and then to report as quickly as possible to the camp. The soldiers then determined what action should be taken. If the news was received late in the day, and the buffalo were at some distance, the camp would probably be moved as near as practicable to where the herd was feeding, and the chase would take place in the early morning.

There it is that they get the wood for various purposes and there it is that they meet and trade with the Indians. If any person were to look for the Eskimos at ‘Big Stick island’ [21] or elsewhere, it must be remembered that the camps will not be found immediately on the Dease or in the valley, but somewhere on or among the surrounding hills. Old camp sites are very numerous on the north side of Dismal lake, particularly at the ‘Narrows’, and it is there where both fish and caribou are numerous that they get the supply of fall skins for clothing. They here get caribou both by hunting on land and by spearing from kayaks as the caribou are swimming. Aside from these two main or more permanent gathering places, the country and the camp sites indicate that the Eskimos are wandering around in small parties.',\n",

Tanner told of his summer activities at Rainy Lake: “I remained in the village until the corn was planted; then we went to collect and dry the blue berries which grow in great quantities in that country. Afterwards to the rice swamps; then we returned to gather our corn. Thus we were busy all during the summer.” Another year reflected the same pattern with the addition of some hunting, as ricing took Tanner to Lake of the Woods: “I spent the summer in the usual quiet manner, being occupied with hunting, and the employments about our cornfields, in gathering wild rice and fishing. When we were returning from the rice swamps, I stopped on one of the small islands in the route towards Rainy Lake, to hunt a bear with whose haunt I had long been acquainted.” [^  9. E.

      "Sentence:  {{221}} “The Eskimo had all summer been making sledges, wooden snow-shovels, bows and spear handles, and other articles of wood. All these things and a good supply of caribou meat were stored at a spot which we called the ‘sled-making place,’ but which the Slaveys of Bear Lake, who know the country well and visit it in winter, call ‘Big Stick Island.’ This is a clump of large spruce trees on the southeast branch of the Dease River. The Eskimo were now waiting for the first snow of the year so they could hitch their dogs to the sleds they had made, load their provisions upon them, and move north toward the coast where they expected to spend the winter sealing. But starvation began to threaten, so that finally, on September 25, the last party started toward the coast, carrying their sleds on their backs, for the first snow had not yet fallen.”\n",

      "Sentence:  {{224}} The scouts sent out by the soldiers were chosen from among the younger men. They acted merely as spies, their office was to find the buffalo. They moved rapidly along, far in advance of the marching column, and from the tops of the highest hills carefully scanned the country before them in search of buffalo. If a herd was discerned, they were not to show themselves, nor in any way to alarm it. Having found the game, their duty was to observe its movement, learn where it was likely to be for the next few hours, and then to report as quickly as possible to the camp. The soldiers then determined what action should be taken. If the news was received late in the day, and the buffalo were at some distance, the camp would probably be moved as near as practicable to where the herd was feeding, and the chase would take place in the early morning. If, on the other hand, the scouts found the herd in the morning, the men would start off at once for the surround, leaving the women to follow, and make camp as near as possible to where the dead buffalo lay.\n",

      "Sentence:  {{221}} It would seem that ‘Big Stick island’ and the country immediately east of Great Bear lake are the main objective points of the Coppermine river Eskimos in their inland excursions in the summer. There it is that they get the wood for various purposes and there it is that they meet and trade with the Indians. If any person were to look for the Eskimos at ‘Big Stick island’ [21] or elsewhere, it must be remembered that the camps will not be found immediately on the Dease or in the valley, but somewhere on or among the surrounding hills. Old camp sites are very numerous on the north side of Dismal lake, particularly at the ‘Narrows’, and it is there where both fish and caribou are numerous that they get the supply of fall skins for clothing. They here get caribou both by hunting on land and by spearing from kayaks as the caribou are swimming. Aside from these two main or more permanent gathering places, the country and the camp sites indicate that the Eskimos are wandering around in small parties.\n",

      "Sentence:  {{221}} This continuity from precontact times to the more recent past can be seen in comparing the accounts of John Tanner, captive of Canadian Ojibway in the early nineteenth century, with those of Maude Kegg, an elder at Mille Lacs in the late twentieth century. Tanner told of his summer activities at Rainy Lake: “I remained in the village until the corn was planted; then we went to collect and dry the blue berries which grow in great quantities in that country. Afterwards to the rice swamps; then we returned to gather our corn. Thus we were busy all during the summer.” Another year reflected the same pattern with the addition of some hunting, as ricing took Tanner to Lake of the Woods: “I spent the summer in the usual quiet manner, being occupied with hunting, and the employments about our cornfields, in gathering wild rice and fishing. When we were returning from the rice swamps, I stopped on one of the small islands in the route towards Rainy Lake, to hunt a bear with whose haunt I had long been acquainted.” [^  9. E.

      "Sentence:  {{224 262 237}} Before the 1810's, the basic food source for the Osnaburgh House Ojibwa had been large game, moose and caribou. The hides of large animals were also important in providing clothing and snowshoe netting. So long as the Ojibwa were able to obtain food and clothing in abundance from subsistence activities, they could survive relatively comfortably. Also numerous cervines supported large cohesive groups of perhaps 25 to 30 people throughout the year. However, by the mid-1810's there is evidence that the large game animals were growing scarce. In 1815, the Osnaburgh trader John Davis, wrote: ['  {{224 262 237}} The condition of most of the Indians is comparatively good though large Famalys scarce ever escaped starvation at some time through the Winter which is owing in a great measure to the decreas of Beaver Moose and Deer… The Cranes only are an exception in this respect their country is better stocked with large animals [^  53.

They left nothing on purpose to breed and keep us the supply, because the white man don't care about the animals. They are after the money. After the white man kills all the game in one place he can take the train and go three hundred miles or more to another and do the same there. But the Indian cannot do that. He must stay on his own section all the time and support his family on what it produces… ']  [' If an Indian went to the old country and sold hunting licenses to the old country people for them to hunt on their own land, the white people would not stand for that… What we Indians want is for the Government to stop the white people killing our game, as they do it for sport and not for support.

The animals had probably separated, he concluded, ‘as it cannot be that the cows outnumber the bulls in this ratio in a country where the Indians are killing the cows at all seasons of the year.’ Perhaps, though, the Indians were ‘killing a lot of yearling bulls.’ [^  12 ~~Rod and Gun,~~ 10 (June 1908), 94; 10 (August 1909), 266; ‘Dixmont,’ ‘Moose Hunting in Temagami,’ ~~Forest and Stream,~~ 9 December 1911, 835–7 ^]\n",

      "Sentence:  {{224}} The Pelly trader's statement — “there is no want of fur bearing animals… but the country is completely exhausted in Moose and Deer, So that if they had not a… supply from the House, they must follow the Buffaloe” — indicates both the dilemma in which many Ojibwa found themselves during these years and their other solution to it. Many Ojibwa claimed that “real starvation” in mid-winter drove them “out to the Plains after the Buffalos.” [^  58 “Real starvation”: HBCA B.159/a/13, Fort Pelly Journal 1831–32, 25 February 1832. See also: HBCA B.159/a/12, Fort Pelly Journal 1830–31, 10 April 1831; HBCA B.159/a/13, Fort Pelly Journal 1831–32, 3, 18, 30 January, 23 February 1832; HBCA B.159/a/15, Fort Pelly Journal 1833–34, 6 December 1833. ^] This was an intensification of a pattern that had been developing for decades. This seeming solution to the lack of other large game sometimes backfired, for the Ojibwa had come to rely on bison during lean seasons, and failure to find the herds presented serious problems ranging from literal starvation to bare survival during cold months of misery. A family of Ojibwa that arrived at Carlton House in late April 1833 had “killed no Furs during the Winter and have had much difficulty in making themselves live;… they saw no Buffalo on their way down the River.” [^  59 “Much difficulty”: HBCA B.27/a/19, Carlton House Journal 1832–33, 28 April 1833. See also: HBCA B.159/a/14, Fort Pelly Journal 1832–33, 16 April 1833; HBCA B.27/a/22, Carlton House Journal 1836–37, 5 June 1836. Ray, ~~Indians in the Fur Trade,~~ p. 220, notes that the herds crossed to the north side of the North Saskatchewan River in January around the Fort Pitt/Carlton area in the 1830s, and moved south again in May and June. ^] For the most part, though, bison did provide an adequate supplement to other resources available in the transitional zone, allowing the Ojibwa to maintain their way of life there.\n",

      "Sentence:  {{439 177 224}} After the cession of Canada to the British in 1759, numerous French and British traders supplied from Montreal located north and west of Lake Superior and thus rejuvenated the competition with the Hudson's Bay Company. In 1782, these Montreal traders united to form the Northwest Company at which time opposition grew intense as both companies established numerous trading centres north of Lake Superior [^  {{443}}  10. Grand Portage near the west end of Lake Superior became an important rendezvous spot to interior regions. After 1790, two sloops conveyed supplies to Grand Portage, and {{443}} from there, Northwest Company traders established numerous and shifting outposts throughout the country north of Lake Superior. The Hudson's Bay Company, to compete, built Gloucester House (1777), Osnaburgh House (1786), Nipigon House (1792), Martin's Falls (1794), Trout Lake (1807), Berens River (1814), in addition to numerous outposts. Prior to the 1770's, the HBC had confined its activities to the coast, the only inland post being Henley House 120 miles inland from Fort Albany which was built in 1743. Henley House had an intermittent history disrupted by Indian attacks until the late 1760's and did not trade furs at this time, but only “country provisions” (venison, fish, hare and geese). Indians still had to go to Fort Albany for their trade goods (see Map 1 for post locations). ^] . Under conditions of keen competition, vast quantities of goods were distributed to Indians. The most important trade items were: guns, powder, shot, hatchets, files, flints, kettles, knives, cloth, Brazil tobacco, and brandy or rum. The introduction of steel traps led to the virtual extermination of the beaver in some regions shortly after 1800. Large animals, caribou and moose, which were hunted to support both Indians and traders soon grew scarce. By 1805, Northwest Company trade had fallen off in northern Ontario, a process that was repeated in western Canada a decade later.\n",

He proceeds toward the buffalo, keeping the wind as nearly in his face as possible, sometimes being obliged to make a circuit of miles to get the wind in the right direction. When near the animals he observes from the top of some hill how they are stationed, which way they travel, and the nature of the ground as regards coulees, gullies, bushes, grass, and any objects that may hide his person from their view and shapes his course according to the means of concealment presented.
